# Map of the Recurse Center

This is a fork of Michael Kreil's [30C3 map](https://github.com/MichaelKreil/30c3-map), with updated dependencies.

Map tiles are fetched from the [blinry/map-of-rc-tiles](https://github.com/blinry/map-of-rc-tiles) repository (or rather, it's GitHub pages deployment, [blinry.github.io/map-of-rc-tiles/](https://blinry.github.io/map-of-rc-tiles/1/0/0.jpg). The tiles in turn are generated from the base SVG at [blinry/map-of-rc](https://github.com/blinry/map-of-rc).
